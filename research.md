I am currently a PhD student at [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paris.fr "Télécom homepage"){:target="_blank"} and [Criteo](https://www.criteo.com "Criteo homepage"){:target="_blank"}.
My work focuses on the theoretical aspects of Deep Learning, and more specifically on Adversarial Robustness. You can find a nice introduction/tutorial on the subject [here](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org "Adversarial robustness tutorial"){:target="_blank"}.

More information on my work is coming soon ;)

### Previous work

I previously worked on two related domains:

- Stochastic processes. During an internship at the Univeristy Paris 1 - Panthéon-Sorbonne, I studied theoretical aspects of Lévy processes.
- Graph theory. I worked on compartmental epidemic models applied to the study of radicalization and terrorism at the University of Barcelona.
